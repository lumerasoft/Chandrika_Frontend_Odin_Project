    <ul>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Soya sauce</li>

    <h3>Steps for preparing Fried Rice</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Season the eggs</b>
            <p>Whisk them with a bit of sesame oil, aminos and salt</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Cook the veggies!</b>
            <p> Stir-fry the carrots. A few minutes later, add the onions, and right at the end, add the garlic. Set them aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Cook the eggs</b>
            <p>Quickly stir-fry / scramble the eggs in a bit of vegetable oil until they’re just set. Add them to your bowl of carrots and onions.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Heat a little vegetable oil and sesame oil</b>
            <p>fry the rice by spreading it in a solid, even layer in the hot pan. Let the rice fry undisturbed for a few minutes, then toss it around a bit and let it fry again</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Bring it all together!</b>
            <p>Carrots, peas, eggs—just add them frozen, they’ll warm up as you incorporate them—green onions, plus a little more coconut aminos and soy sauce.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
